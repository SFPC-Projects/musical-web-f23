    description: `in this piece, there's two instances of Arkanoid for the NES being emulated in their own windows (also known as "dumplings"). the sound from the games was removed, and instead a program is looking into the game's memory to detect changes in ball movement direction, and trigger multiple granulator samplers, with parameters affected by the dumpling's position and size.

i've been exploring this idea of "plunderludics", borrowing from the "plunderphonics" notion of creating music out of existing pieces, i explore the idea of using emulated video games as material for creating new works, and recontextualizing playing the original game.

i am also interested in the idea of performing with videogames, in particular thinking of videogames as (musical) instruments, pushing their play beyond winning or losing. one main influence in this regard is David Kanaga, in particular his writings of videogames as shifting possibility space instruments. a second influence is David Sudnow's Pilgrim in the Microworld, an account of a musician and sociologist getting obsessed with breakout (arkanoid), the game chosen for this.`,

    description: `Experiences on the web today are mostly extractive — they require something from you: attention, interactions, mouse and keyboard input, credit cards, likes, shares — all of them together or in various combinations. There are not many places where you can just sit and watch, meditate, dream, and experience a calmer side of the web. This is what Particle Music aims to be — a place where you can spend a few minutes, or multiple hours, undistracted, floating through an unfolding cosmos.`,

    description: `With 'Rotation' my aim is to depict a dynamic landscape. As the environment shifts from day to night, time seems to stutter, stop, and speed by in a non-linear fashion. This continuous fluctuation of color, sound, and perspective activates memory using very few visual signifiers. Visuals are generated in-browser; audio is processed using Max/MSP and translated to the web using RNBO. `

    description: `This virtual theremin allows users to interact with an ASCII videoscape, generating sounds through the position of their index fingers. Users can intentionally or accidentally play samples and trigger visual changes by touching specific coordinates on the frame or moving in a certain speed, resulting in a dynamic auditory experience.

The samples used by the theremin are sourced from the web, mostly from royalty free stock libraries. Some relate to the the ideas of past, present, and future, while some represent certain instruments (piano, chimes, drums). Others are simply random.`

    description: `Time is not experienced uniformly across the various elements that make up our world. The entirety of a human life - every formative experience, every chapter, every moment of struggle, failure, perseverance, pain - fits neatly within a span of (up to, rarely beyond) a century. A blink of an eye for a mountain emerging from the ocean bed over many millions of years. A brief stint in the eyes of an ancient olive tree. An eternity for a mayfly. Though huge disparity exists in how we experience it, we share the experience itself, each expression of this world with it's own rhythm, marching forward.

I wanted to create a piece that revolved around these disparities in the scale of time and provide the opportunity for the user to form different compositions by adjusting the time scale for each sound. I invite you to explore how altering this one component can dramatically alter the character and momentum of a composition.`,
