      <h2>The Musical Web - Fall 2023</h2>
      <h3>About The Class</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Musical Web was a 10-week class focused on
          reskilling music composition, co-exploring musicality on the web,
          and re-thinking ways to share musical experiences online. The goal was to
          make art through a modern medium and to acknowledge
          HTML, CSS and Javascript as musical tools. Together, we explored chance, live
          web APIs, multiperson networking technology, and a variety of other frameworks
          for creating sound on the web.

          <p><b>Chloe Alexandra Thompson (she/her)</b></p>
          <p>
            Thompson is a Cree, Canadian, interdisciplinary artist and sound
            designer. Thompson approaches sound as a mode of
            connection—embracing the kinesthetic agency of sound to compose
            abstract feats of spatialized audio recording and synthesis. Her
            work engages tactics of material minimalism to create site-specific
            installations that sculpt droning, maximalist experiences out of
            space and sound. Using audio programming software, computational
            processing, and acoustic instruments, Thompson’s work seeks to
            create connection by guiding audience participants through these
            augmented experiences.
