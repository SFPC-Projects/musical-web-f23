      <h2>The Musical Web - Fall 2023</h2>
      <h3>About The Class</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Musical Web was a 10-week sound and code course focused on the
          reskilling of music composition, co-exploring musicality on the web,
          and re-thinking distributional methods for our sounds. The goal was to
          make radical art that used a contemporary medium and technologies, to
          see HTML, CSS and Javascript as musical tools, and to learn audio
          processing in p5.js and Max. Together, we gained a broad spectrum
          knowledge of the various tools and approaches used for working with
          sound on the web.

        <p><b>Tommy Martinez (he/him)</b></p>
        <p>
          Tommy is a musician, programmer, and organizer investigating
          algorithmic approaches to sound composition, simulations, and
          manifestations of identity, tradition and history in electronic
          culture. He has lectured on computer music and media art and is a
          professor at School of Visual Arts. Tommy is the co-editor of Software
          for Artists Book: Untethering the Web (Pioneer Works Press, 2022), and
          currently a Brooklyn College Sonic Arts MFA candidate.

          <p><b>Chloe Alexandra Thompson (she/her)</b></p>
          <p>
            Thompson is a Cree, Canadian, interdisciplinary artist and sound
            designer. Thompson approaches sound as a mode of
            connection—embracing the kinesthetic agency of sound to compose
            abstract feats of spatialized audio recording and synthesis. Her
            work engages tactics of material minimalism to create site-specific
            installations that sculpt droning, maximalist experiences out of
            space and sound. Using audio programming software, computational
            processing, and acoustic instruments, Thompson’s work seeks to
            create connection by guiding audience participants through these
            augmented experiences.
